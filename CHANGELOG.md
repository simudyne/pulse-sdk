# CHANGELOG


## v0.7.0-dev.7 (2026-09-21)

### Features

- **validation**: Three endpoints, one vocabulary
  ([`857e4c4`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/857e4c4197c5006c3e54b9d7f5247186ec0d034a))

Matches pulse-check and the API pod so the same words mean the same thing everywhere.

- run submits and returns; get_job is the status endpoint; list_jobs reaches past runs.
  run_pipeline, run_upload, display_plots, PlotDisplay and inception_distances are gone — run_upload
  folds into run as sim_files - One flag per area: statistical, stylised_facts, impact,
  volume_correlation, fid, mind, plus lob/sample_period/match_generated_sample. Every run_*,
  l2_only, plot_data and historical_output alias is gone. plot_data in particular was never the
  caller's to set: the tier decides whether the historical half comes back, and dropping the
  parameter does not loosen that - provider and exchange are required: the same symbol exists under
  both providers with different dates and tick sizes, so (symbol, provider, exchange) is the
  identity - get_job takes plot_dir and writes any rendered figures to disk, defaulting to the
  current directory, returning the paths in plot_paths

822 lines to 346.

## v0.7.0-dev.6 (2026-09-21)

### Bug Fixes

- **docs**: Document every SDK endpoint in numpy style
  ([`3a86f16`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/3a86f16e1feba720093e4dcd54fd16b82524b547))

An audit of all 45 public methods found gaps the format conversion did not touch, because these
  docstrings had nothing to convert.

- api_keys.create/list/revoke and profile.get/usage had NO docstring at all, so five endpoints
  rendered in pulse-docs as a bare signature - validation.run, run_pipeline and run_upload accept
  24-26 arguments and documented only some: the pulse-check 1.10.0 area flags (statistical,
  stylised_facts, impact, volume_correlation, fid, mind) and the extra schema fields (lob,
  sample_period, match_generated_sample, plots, historical_output) were described only in module
  comments. run_upload was also missing the seven config flags it shares with run -
  profile.downloads and display_plots had prose docstrings with no numpy sections

griffe's numpy parser now reads all 45 docstrings and 156 parameters, up from 132, with zero
  undocumented arguments across the SDK.

Docstrings only: the executable code of every touched file is identical to origin/dev once
  docstrings are stripped.

## v0.7.0-dev.5 (2026-09-21)

### Bug Fixes

- **docs**: Convert the SDK docstrings to numpy style
  ([`0008571`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/00085715413bbe9eac1a52b5734147704cb1e01c))

pulse-docs sets docstring_style: numpy in mkdocs.yml, but every docstring was Google style. griffe's
  numpy parser does not recognise Args:/Returns:, so each one collapsed into a single
  undifferentiated text section and the SDK reference rendered as flat prose with no parameter or
  returns tables.

- Convert 34 docstrings across simulation, validation, fm, simulator_gym, data and fix; griffe now
  parses 132 parameters that it previously saw as body text - Types and defaults come from the real
  signatures, so "str | None" with a None default renders as "str, optional" rather than repeating
  itself

Docstrings only: the executable code of every touched file is identical to origin/dev once
  docstrings are stripped.

## v0.7.0-dev.4 (2026-09-18)

### Features

- **validation**: Areas, sampling, plot selection and DataFrame runs
  ([`b740519`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/b7405191e9c402f48e4b6ae66f9a6033584a1c72))

Exposes what pulse-check 1.10.0 added, all opt-in: a job naming none of it sends exactly the config
  it sent before.

- statistical / stylised_facts / impact / volume_correlation / fid / mind select areas of checking
  individually - lob marks the frames as L2 snapshots; sample_period and match_generated_sample set
  the grid the book is resampled onto - plots takes True or a list of plot ids; historical_output is
  the demo-only gate that plot_data used to be - run_upload now accepts a polars or pandas DataFrame
  per run as well as a path or a (name, bytes) pair, written to parquet in memory. The frame must be
  pulse format, which the server validates

The options are explicit keyword parameters rather than **options: the suite asserts that removed
  spellings like run_fid raise TypeError, and a catch-all would have swallowed them into a
  ValueError deeper down.

## v0.7.0-dev.3 (2026-09-09)

### Bug Fixes

- Accept the documented filter params — get_available_symbols(q), get_jobs(limit)
  ([`7ea5010`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/7ea5010e90c68e40956b650feb25027e5bc20ee4))

The docs suite's Response Shapes job checks the SDK against the live API and found two documented
  parameters the SDK did not accept: the q substring search on /data/available-symbols (docs:
  "searches ticker and company name") and the limit on /simulation/jobs (docs promise
  jobs/total/returned paging). Both routes already support them; the SDK just never passed them
  through.

## v0.7.0-dev.2 (2026-09-09)

### Documentation

- **validation**: Mind/fid reach every tier as of pulse-api-pod 1.56.0
  ([`fb92309`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/fb923093bad9664b77e61adb7e277b27f6bd8efe))

The scores were demo-only; the API now shares them with every validation tier since they are
  aggregate scalars. Docstrings and the empty-score error message updated to say so.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

### Features

- Complete the documented 0.8.0 surface — fm, fix, run_upload, job logs, LRM
  ([`2cc74ee`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/2cc74eec77cd21a664f1e93feaa6269893bd744f))

The website docs (and its docs code-block suite) describe SDK methods that did not exist yet, which
  is what the suite's simudyne-pulse>=0.8.0 tripwire pin guards against. This adds the missing
  surface, matching the docs pages and the pulse-api-pod routes each method wraps:

- validation.run_upload(): multipart POST /validation/run/upload for frames not stored in Pulse.
  sim_files takes paths or (filename, bytes) pairs; 1-25 enforced client-side with ValueError before
  any bytes move; same tri-state run flags as run() via a shared _build_config(). -
  simulation.get_job_logs(): GET /simulation/jobs/{id}/logs, returned as the plain text it is (via
  the retrying transport, not the JSON helper). - simulation.run_lrm(): POST /simulation/lrm/run,
  mirroring LRMRunRequest — one algo per order size over a shared baseline. - fm resource: models(),
  available_data() (registry search with server-side filters, None params omitted), run()
  (duration_minutes/horizon, n_runs 1-8, model_args, device, exec_algos — unset fields omitted so
  server defaults hold), live(), job_status(), job_logs(), and TERMINAL_STATUSES = {complete,
  failed}, which the foundation-models docs page imports. - fix resource: usage().

Also refreshes validation docstrings for the impact-response tier change (pulse 2.17.0 /
  pulse-api-pod 1.62.0): the pass runs at every tier, the simulated curves are returned everywhere,
  the historical block stays demo/plot_data-only, and get_job() documents impact_response_error.

13 new payload tests in the existing recorder style; the 10 pre-existing test_simulator_gym failures
  locally are a missing websocket-client in the local env, unchanged by this commit.

## v0.7.0-dev.1 (2026-08-19)

### Chores

- **validation**: Take prod's validation.py (run_stylised_facts tri-state)
  ([`d83e31b`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/d83e31b8eac4e1d2898ca276554513c18215d424))

dev is 4 commits behind prod and its validation.py lacks the run_stylised_facts tri-state added
  there. Bringing that one file forward first so the inception-distance work below builds on it
  instead of reverting it.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

### Features

- **validation**: Mind/fid via run_inception_distances, drop dead params
  ([`99cd8ba`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/99cd8bad9f10b2cb8ef98a9518a4e258156ad77f))

pulse-check 1.8.0 replaced the raw-feature FID with MIND and FID on DeepLOB embeddings — one
  embedding pass computes both — and removed rescale_volumes/lot_size, since simudyne format is
  always denominated in shares. The API (>= 1.55.1) returns mind_scores alongside fid_scores.

- run_fid -> run_inception_distances, default True: the old name described one of the two metrics it
  gates, so run_fid=False silently disabled MIND too. Still sent as the API's run_fid config field,
  which keeps its name for existing HTTP clients. The old kwarg now raises TypeError rather than
  being quietly ignored. - inception_distances(): one call returning {mind, fid, sim_ids, job_id},
  forcing the other passes off so the job does a single embedding pass. Raises when the scores are
  absent — a skipped pass and a non-demo key are both silent in the raw response. -
  run_metrics/run_impact join run_stylised_facts and plot_data as tri-state (None = tier default,
  omitted from the payload). Previously the SDK always sent run_impact=False, opting demo keys out
  of a pass they are entitled to. - rescale_volumes/lot_size removed; l2_only, provider and exchange
  added to match the API. get_job() documents mind_scores, the demo-tier rule, and that fid_scores
  is now the embedding-space FID, not comparable with values stored by older jobs. -
  tests/test_validation.py: 9 tests pinning the wire payload, the rename and the score handling.
  None existed before.

## v0.6.1 (2026-08-05)

### Bug Fixes

- **simulation**: Correct stale flash_crash/buy_panic scenario defaults
  ([`af10951`](https://github.com/simudyne/pulse-sdk/commit/af1095184277f593aeadded35fac34ac8d598823))

- both advertised 22.0/0.19/500ms while the engine has used 150.0/0.02/100ms since pulse 2.4.7
  (07c176e1), so anyone sizing a scenario from get_scenario_defaults got ~7x the impact shown - note
  the mirroring requirement against EIB/calcs/scenarios.py, whose builder signatures SimulationRun
  backfills from
