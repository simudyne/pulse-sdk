"""
Foundation Models Resource for the Pulse SDK.

A foundation-model (FM) run generates limit order book activity by continuing
from real market data rather than simulating agents. The platform slices the
model's required context out of the chosen market's data, runs inference, and
writes the output using the same conventions as an agent-based run — so the
ordinary simulation results and download endpoints work unchanged.

Workflow:
    1. Discover models with models() — each entry lists the markets it
       supports and the model_args it accepts
    2. Find a promptable symbol/date with available_data(model_id=...)
    3. Submit inference with run() -> returns job_id and sim_ids
    4. Poll job_status(job_id) until it reaches a TERMINAL_STATUSES value;
       read job_logs(job_id) when it failed
    5. Download with client.simulation.get_sim_data(sim_id) — an FM sim_id is
       an ordinary sim_id

The output file contains the model's prompt context as well as its generated
frames: the leading rows of sim_data.parquet are real market data. The split
is recorded in the parquet file-level metadata (``pulse_fm.n_historical``,
``pulse_fm.n_generated``, ``pulse_fm.segments``) — drop the context rows
before computing statistics on the generated activity.

        ----------
        model_id : str, optional

            Exact symbol, e.g. "TSCO" or "700".
        q : str, optional
            Case-insensitive substring match over the symbol.
        provider : str, optional
            Data provider, e.g. "bmll".
        exchange : str, optional
            Protocol, e.g. "lse" or "hkex_securities".
        date : str, optional
            Trading date YYYY-MM-DD; keeps only symbols with data on it,
            and only that date.
        limit : int, default 50
            Max symbols to return (default 50, max 200).
        offset : int, default 0
            Symbols to skip, for paging.

        symbol : str

        device : str, optional
            "cpu" or "gpu"; None uses the model's default.
        exec_algos : list, optional
