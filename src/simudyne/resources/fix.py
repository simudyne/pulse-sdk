"""
FIX Resource for the Pulse SDK.

Pulse simulations can be consumed over the FIX protocol by a market-data
session instead of the REST download endpoints. The FIX connection itself is
provisioned per organisation (see the FIX docs page); this resource covers
what the SDK can usefully do about it — reporting what your account has run
over FIX.
